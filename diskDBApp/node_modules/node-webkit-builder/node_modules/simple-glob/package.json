Instead of reinventing the wheel, I figured I'd just extract the code directly from [Grunt][]'s code base to get the exact same functionality that we know and love. Now, we can all enjoy the same globbing, even outside of [Grunt][]!\n\n<i>Full disclaimer: The code contained in this project is 99% the original work of the Grunt.js team. I only renamed a couple things and moved things around a bit. I take no credit whatsoever and the original license is in tact, according to license conditions.</i>\n\n<i>Note: The following documentation was taken mostly from [Grunt's Configuring Tasks][] page.</i>\n\n\n## Globbing patterns\n\nIt is often impractical to specify all source filepaths individually, so simple-glob supports filename expansion (also know as globbing) via the built-in [node-glob][] and [minimatch][] libraries.\n\nWhile this isn't a comprehensive tutorial on globbing patterns, know that in a filepath:\n\n- `*` matches any number of characters, but not `/`\n- `?` matches a single character, but not `/`\n- `**` matches any number of characters, including `/`, as long as it's the only thing in a path part\n- `{}` allows for a comma-separated list of \"or\" expressions\n- `!` at the beginning of a pattern will negate the match\n\nAll most people need to know is that `foo/*.js` will match all files ending with `.js` in the `foo/` subdirectory, but `foo/**/*.js` will match all files ending with `.js` in the `foo/` subdirectory and all of its subdirectories.\n\nAlso, in order to simplify otherwise complicated globbing patterns, simple-glob allows arrays of file paths or globbing patterns to be specified. Patterns are processed in-order, with `!`-prefixed matches excluding matched files from the result set. The result set is uniqued.\n\nFor example:\n```js\nvar glob = require('simple-glob');\n\n// You can specify single files:\nglob('foo/this.js');\n// Or arrays of files:\nglob(['foo/this.js', 'foo/that.js', 'foo/the-other.js']);\n// Or you can generalize with a glob pattern:\nglob('foo/th*.js');\n\n// This single node-glob pattern:\nglob('foo/{a,b}*.js');\n// Could also be written like this:\nglob(['foo/a*.js', 'foo/b*.js']);\n\n// All .js files, in foo/, in alpha order:\nglob(['foo/*.js']);\n// Here, bar.js is first, followed by the remaining files, in alpha order:\nglob(['foo/bar.js', 'foo/*.js']);\n\n// All files except for bar.js, in alpha order:\nglob(['foo/*.js', '!foo/bar.js']);\n// All files in alpha order, but with bar.js at the end.\nglob(['foo/*.js', '!foo/bar.js', 'foo/bar.js']);\n```\n\nFor more on glob pattern syntax, see the [node-glob][] and [minimatch][] documentation.\n\n\n\n[![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/jedmao/simple-glob/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free \"Bitdeli Badge\")\n\n\n[Grunt]: http://gruntjs.com/\n[Build Status]: https://secure.travis-ci.org/jedmao/simple-glob.png?branch=master\n[Dependency Status]: https://gemnasium.com/jedmao/simple-glob.png\n[NPM version]: https://badge.fury.io/js/simple-glob.png\n[Views]: https://sourcegraph.com/api/repos/github.com/jedmao/simple-glob/counters/views-24h.png\n[NPM]: https://nodei.co/npm/simple-glob.png?downloads=true\n[Grunt's Configuring Tasks]: http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks\n[node-glob]: https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob\n[minimatch]: https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch\n",
